# -Ensemble-Machine-Learning-Model-to-Predict-Early-Stage-Diabetes-Risk.

The project aims to develop a machine learning ensemble model that can predict the risk of developing diabetes in individuals at an early stage. Therefore, the proposed project will help healthcare professionals to identify high-risk patients and provide timely interventions to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes.
The project will use a combination of machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees,Random Forests and ensemble methods to develop a predictive model for diabetes risk. The dataset used for training and testing the model is obtained from the kaggle . The dataset will include a variety of features such as No of Pregnancies,Glucose,BloodPressure,SkinThickness,Insulin,BMI,DiabetesPedigreeFunction,Age.
